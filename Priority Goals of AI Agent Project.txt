“Priority Goals of AI Agent Project”:

Ship a ChatGPT-style UI at ai.olivogalarza.com with an input box and a transcript showing all user messages and LLM answers.

That UI must answer from the KB; if confidence is low or the KB is insufficient, it should gracefully use open web sources to produce the answer.

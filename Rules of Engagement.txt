Rules of Engagement (RoE) v1.1 — AI Agent (Inmigración a España)

1) Domain routing (“Inmigración a España”)

If the question is about immigration to Spain: use the KB first. If confidence is low, do a web fallback.

If the question is not about immigration but appears in the KB: still answer from the KB and also check the web for the most recent info; cite those sources (hidden by default).

If the question is not about immigration and not in the KB: respond exactly, “Esta IA está especializada en temas de Inmigración a España.”

Use a lightweight domain classifier (keywords with an optional quick LLM check) to set the domain flag.

Use the top KB hit score to decide on web fallback (threshold ≈ 0.55 when kbOnly=false).

2) Accuracy & grounding

Every claim must be supported by KB or web sources; never fabricate citations.

When web fallback is used, include at least 1–3 official URLs in the citations (kept hidden by default).

Prefer official/primary sources in this order: BOE and ministerial → autonómico/consular → others.

For volatile topics (tasas, formularios, convocatorias), state the update date and prefer the latest valid version; if sources conflict, prefer the newer official one and note the reconciliation.

3) Behavior when unsure

If neither the KB nor the web provides support, reply exactly: “Respuesta incierta. Contáctenos.”

4) Citations hidden by default

Do not display sources automatically. Show them only when the user clicks “Ver fuentes” or explicitly asks.

In the UI, keep the sources panel collapsible and collapsed by default; only render links when expanded.

5) Completeness & style (Spanish, 3–6 sentences, neutral legal tone)

Answer in Spanish, with 3–6 sentences, concise legal tone.

Use bullet points for procedures and bold for key terms.

The finalization step should trim or expand to land within 3–6 sentences unless the user requested more detail.

6) Guardrails / disclaimer

Show this disclaimer once per session (on the first answer):“Esta IA puede cometer errores; use la información de forma referencial y contáctenos ante cualquier duda.”

Track whether it’s been shown with a session-scoped flag.

7) Formatting rules

Procedures → bullets; key terms in negrita.

If an answer exceeds six sentences, prepend a brief “Resumen:” line before the full text.

Keep formatting minimal and avoid over-processing the model’s output.

8) Session memory

Maintain rolling context for the same chat (roughly the last 8–10 turns) and include it in answer generation.

Bound context length to control token cost and avoid drift.

9) Routing flow (narrative, no code)

Classify the query’s domain and run KB retrieval.

If out of domain and there are no KB hits, return the specialization message.

If KB confidence is below the threshold and web is allowed, run the web fallback and merge evidence.

If there is still no grounded evidence, return the “Respuesta incierta” text.

Finalize the answer in Spanish with the style constraints; apply formatting; keep citations hidden unless requested.

10) Web fallback guardrails (volatile topics)

Trigger web fallback even with decent KB scores when the query involves tasas, formularios, convocatorias, or contains “última/actualizada/vigente”.

Prefer official domains (e.g., BOE, ministerial, sedes electrónicas, official consulates).

Cap external sources to a small, authoritative set and record the date of each cited item.

11) Metrics & alerts

Track: domain routing rates (in-domain vs out-of-domain), web fallback rate, official-hit rate, unsure rate, style compliance (average sentence count; presence of bullets for procedures), and freshness (days since last update on volatile claims).

Set alerts for spikes in “Respuesta incierta”, drops in official-hit rate, or stale-date usage.

12) Unit-test checklist (textual)

Domain detection: “Requisitos arraigo social” must be in domain.

Out-of-domain: “H-1B USA” with no KB hit must return the specialization message.

Fallback trigger: low KB score must cause a web check.

Unsure path: no evidence must return the exact unsure string.

Style: answers must land in 3–6 sentences with bold key terms and bullets where a procedure is detected.

Disclaimer: appears only on the first answer of the session.

13) Nice-to-haves (near-term)

Add a computed confidence score (gap between top KB hits + citation density) to feed human review gates.

Integrate permission tiers for any tool with side effects (read-only by default).

Persist a brief session summary every 3–5 turns to stabilize context (with user consent).
